# Snake-Game
This Java-based Snake game uses Swing for its GUI, featuring a grid-based play area, dynamic snake, and random apples. It handles collisions, tracks scores, and accepts keyboard inputs. It also connects to a MySQL database for storing scores and includes audio for background music and effects.
